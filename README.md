Cryptaroo_Android
=================

Cryptaroo is a mobile cryptanalysis tool intended to be handy in doing basic encryption/decryption techniques or analyzing ciphertext. Cryptaroo is largely based upon Gary Watson's desktop application CryptoHelper. CryptoHelper can be found at http://cryptohelper.sourceforge.net/ . The source code for Cryptaroo (Android) can be found at https://github.com/wesselj1/Cryptaroo_Android . The source code for Cryptaroo (iOS) can be found at https://github.com/wesselj1/Cryptaroo_iOS . Cryptaroo, as with CryptoHelper, is open-source and licensed under terms of the GNU General Public License.

NOTE: Font used in application is not licensed for free distribution so I cannot include it in the repo. I will be adding  a fix later so it will not crash trying to make the asset.
NOTE 2: iOS source code is not yet public, app not finished.
